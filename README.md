## Known issues

+ Very inefficient usage of network for voting
+ User's can re-vote for the same photo, need to remember photos that have already been voted on and remove them from future display
+ App is ugly as hell

## Future features

+ Hot list will grow, subdivide by tags
+ Add falloff algorithm for hot list (scrub old content)
